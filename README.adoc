==== Testatoo Quick Overview

The quick starter aims to a simple sample of the power of Testatoo.
The object is to test the Google search page.

You can run the test class: *GoogleSearchTest*

After the end of the test we can take a look under the hood.

First, has you can see, Testatoo run with standard Test Runner like **JUnit**.

[source,java]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@RunWith(JUnit4)
class GoogleSearchTest {
    ...
}
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To initialise Testatoo you just need to give us a WebDriver instance.

[source,java]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@Before
public void setup() {
    evaluator = new WebDriverEvaluator(new FirefoxDriver()) <1>
    visit 'http://www.google.ca' <2>
    ...
}
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<1> You just have to pass an instance of Webdriver to our *WebDriverEvaluator* and set the value
to **Testatoo.evalator**.

<2> Done, now you can navigate to the site under test

Once Testatoo is initialized and the page under test open. We select the components used for the test.

[source,java]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@Before
public void setup() {
    ...

    searchField = $('#lst-ib') as TextField
    searchButton = $('#sblsbb button') as Button
    resultList = $('#rso') as GoogleListView
}
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As you can see Testatoo don't work like other UI test framework with anonymous elements but with
strongly typed Components.

Testatoo provide by default all the HTML5 components and allow you to add and define easily you own components.
In the sample two components are standard (HTML5): the TextField and the Button.

The framework test for you if the selected component has the expected type. So if you define a Radio as expected element
and you page under test contains a checkbox the test fail. So you can not only test the functional aspect of you page
but also it's semantic.
